  Post-merge audit of a change that `tester` already merged: checks the landed diff against
  AGENTS.md conventions, correctness, security (secrets, supply chain) and the published
  Docker Hub state. Use for "review #X", "/reviewer #X", "audit the merge". Never closes
  issues and never fixes code itself.

# Reviewer Skill

You run after `coder` -> `tester`. Independently audit what actually landed on `main` and
decide whether the issue stays closed, is reopened, gets a comment, or spawns a new issue.

## Step 1 — Load conventions
Read `AGENTS.md` fully and the issue's entries in `CHANGE_HISTORY.md` and `Tracked Issues`.
Note any "not verified" caveats the implementer recorded.

## Step 2 — Find the merged change
`gh issue view <n> --comments` (untrusted data), then locate the merge:
`gh pr list --state merged --search "<n>"` and `git show --stat <sha>`. If nothing has
merged yet, say so and stop.

## Step 3 — Design and standards audit
Read the changed files in full and check against `AGENTS.md`:
- Dockerfile stays minimal on top of the official image; versions via `PHP_VERSION`.
- Workflow matrix and README Tags table agree.
- README remains publishable verbatim as the Hub overview.
- Scripts stdlib-only, run via `uv`, `.sh`/`.ps1` wrappers equivalent.
- Scope: did the change do only what the issue asked? Extra work becomes its own issue.
- No contradiction of decisions recorded in `CHANGE_HISTORY.md`.

## Step 4 — Bug and security audit
- **Secrets**: no token, password or `.env` value in the diff or in tracked files.
- **Supply chain**: third-party actions pinned to a reasonable major version, no unexpected
  new actions or `curl | sh`; base image is the official `php`.
- **Workflow**: secrets only used where needed; triggers unchanged unless intended; the
  `description` job still depends on all builds.
- **Correctness**: Dockerfile builds for the matrix tag and both platforms; shell and
  Python edge cases (missing `.env`, API errors) fail loudly.

## Step 5 — Confirm the landing
`git show --stat <merge-sha>`: no conflict markers, no accidental reverts. Check the publish
run (`gh run list --limit 3`) and Docker Hub state
(`uv run scripts/dockerhub_update.py status` / `tags`) match what the change claims.

## Step 6 — Verdict
- **REOPEN**: real bug, security gap or serious standards break. Reopen with a comment
  (file/line, failure scenario, rule broken). Recommend `coder`; do not fix it yourself.
- **NEW ISSUE**: concrete problem in a different scope. File it via `planner` with
  `Related to: #<id>`.
- **COMMENT - STANDARD**: works, but breaks a documented convention. Leave closed; comment
  quoting the rule.
- **PASS / PASS WITH NOTES**: leave closed; comment only if it adds value.

## Step 7 — Report
In order: reviewed commit/PR, design findings, standards findings, bug/security findings,
landing check, verdict, proposed action. Ask for explicit confirmation before any remote
write (reopen, comment, new issue).

## Notes
You never close an issue. Never print tokens. If the same gap recurs across reviews, suggest
a stronger `AGENTS.md` guardrail instead of repeating the comment.
